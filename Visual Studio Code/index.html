    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shiva Chemburkar and I am an amateur website developer and aspiring data scientist. I grew up in San
        Ramon, CA and graduated from Cal Poly SLO in 2020 with a B.S. in Environmental Earth and Soil Science. I had
        various internships and jobs in the environmental field with my latest experience being a Staff Geologist I at
        Environmental Resources Management <a href="https://www.erm.com/">ERM-West</a>. Feel free to connect with me
        about any coding projects you may be seeking help with <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivachemburkar/">(LinkedIn)</a>.</p>

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>I have taken two Udemy courses to understand the basics of front end and back end programming. I took a course
        taught by Jose Portilla on Python basics along with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course teaching HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript. I am currently working on the front end of a new application called SRF that aims to
        teach new surfers different exercises that will improve their knowledge and skill of the sport.</p>
